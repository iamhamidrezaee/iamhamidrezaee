# Hamid Rezaee

## Bio
I am Hamid (ˈhaː.med), and I study Information Science and Entrepreneurship as an undergraduate at the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell University, class of 2026. I am the co-founder and CTO of Luga AI, working towards addressing the underrepresentation of Arabic in generative AI space.

I have worked as a machine learning intern at LessonLoop, a startup in EdTech industry, where I tested and deployed RAG-based chatbots on AWS to provide personalized tips and recommendations to instructors. 

I worked as a recommendation engine developer for Gig-Up, an e-commerce platform registered with Cornell eLab, where I designed the architecture for the recommendation engine and developed, maintained, and optimized it regularly. 

I am a member of the machine learning subteam at Cornell University Sustainable Design project. I developed and tested a LightGBM model that can optimize the energy efficiency of building heating and cooling systems, planned to be deployed across Cornell campus buildings on Fall 2024. 

Currently, I am doing machine learning research at Cornell Tech under Prof. Mert Sabuncu, Vice Chair of AI and Engineering Research at Cornell University. I am working on creating a robust loss function that could significantly outperforms the current loss functions used in medical imaging. My work consists of training the model on the loss function and performing comprehensive hyperparameter optimization.
 
I mainly program in Python and the libraries and resources that I use very often are: 
PyTorch, NumPy, and scikit-learn for research,
Flask, FastAPI, Git, Docker, Vercel, and AWS EC2 for backend development, version control, and deployment.
AWS Bedrock, CloudFormation, and SageMaker for LLM integration, training, or fine-tuning, and

Lastly, I have a human side too and don't just work all day long. I am a creative writer and recently get into film making as well. I am a big gamer and 'Need For Speed Unbound' carries me every day. I am super extroverted so definitely don't hesitate in reaching out and saying hi so we can have a chat about machine learning research, LLMs, and the recent advancements in the field or simply chat about dogs and how cute they are :)
