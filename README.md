# Hamid Rezaee

## Bio
I am Hamid (ˈhaː.med), and I study Information Science as an undergraduate at the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell University, class of 2026. 

I mainly program in Python and the libraries and resources that I use very often are:
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn for machine learning applications and research,
- Flask, Git, Docker, Vercel, and AWS for backend development, version control, and deployment,
- AWS Bedrock, CloudFormation, and SageMaker for LLM integration, training, or fine-tuning, and Inference,
- Hugging Face and Transformers for local LLM hosting, inference, and optimization.

Lastly, I have a human side too and don't just work all day long. I am a creative writer and recently get into film making as well. I am a big gamer and 'Need For Speed Unbound' carries me every day. I am super extroverted so definitely don't hesitate in reaching out and saying hi so we can have a chat about machine learning research, LLMs, and the recent advancements in the field or simply chat about video games and GTA VI :)
